        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p> Hello! My name is Francisco Irazaba, and I am a third-year <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> student at <strong>Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo</strong>. I have a passion for a 
            wide range of activities, including going to the gym, hiking, playing tennis, and skateboarding. Throughout my time at Cal Poly, I have 
            developed strong programming skills in <em>Python</em>, <em>Java</em>, and <em>C</em>. In addition to my coursework, I have independently learned front-end development 
            languages like <em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em>, and I am currently deepening my knowledge of <em>JavaScript</em>. I aspire to acquire a position in a Software Development 
            or Embedded Systems role where I can leverage my technical expertise.
