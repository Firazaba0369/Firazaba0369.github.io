                    <p> Hello! My name is Francisco Irazaba, and I am a third-year <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> 
                    student at <strong>Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo</strong>. I have a passion for a wide range of activities, 
                    including going to the gym, hiking, playing tennis, and skateboarding. Throughout my time at Cal Poly, I 
                    have developed strong programming skills in <em>Python</em>, <em>Java</em>, and <em>C</em>. In addition 
                    to my coursework, I have independently learned front-end development languages like <em>HTML</em> and 
                    <em>CSS</em>, and I am currently deepening my knowledge of <em>JavaScript</em>. I aspire to acquire a 
                    position in a Software Development or Embedded Systems role where I can leverage my technical expertise.</p>
